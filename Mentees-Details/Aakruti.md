Hi, my name is Aakruti Kalia!

## About Me
I am a passionate developer working on NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. I have experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. I've recently gotten addicted to Open Source!

## GitHub
You can find me on GitHub at [@akku-07]([https://github.com/akku-07])

## Interests
Some of my interests include playing guitar, and watching crime/mystery/romcom shows & movies on my recliner all day! I also love driving, and taking road trips. Additionally, I also design and edit a lot on Canva! (If someone's hungry for pizza, it makes me hungry tooðŸ˜‹)âœ¨

I'm really excited to be a part of this cohort and looking forward to learning and collaborating with everyone!
